                    <p>Arctic Monkeys' sales in the US alone stand at over 30 million units, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. They have won seven Brit Awards, winning Best British Group and British Album of the Year three times, becoming the first band to ever "do the double"—that is, win in both categories—three times; a Mercury Prize for Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not; an Ivor Novello Award and 20 NME Awards. They have been nominated for nine Grammy Awards,[10] and received Mercury Prize nominations in 2007, 2013, 2018 and 2023.[11] Both Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not and AM are included in NME and different editions of Rolling Stone's lists of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".
